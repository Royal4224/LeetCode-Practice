### 233. Number of Digit One
 
Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

### Move Zeros To End

Given a static-sized array of integers arr, move all zeroes in the array to the end of the array. You should preserve the relative order of items in the array.

We should implement a solution that is more efficient than a naive brute force.

Examples:
```
input:  arr = [1, 10, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 5, 7, 0]
output: [1, 10, 2, 8, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
### Array of Array Products
Given an array of integers arr, you’re asked to calculate for each index i the product of all integers except the integer at that index (i.e. except arr[i]). Implement a function arrayOfArrayProducts that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

Solve without using division and analyze your solution’s time and space complexities.

Examples:
```
input:  arr = [8, 10, 2]
output: [20, 16, 80] # by calculating: [10*2, 8*2, 8*10]

input:  arr = [2, 7, 3, 4]
output: [84, 24, 56, 42] # by calculating: [7*3*4, 2*3*4, 2*7*4, 2*7*3]
```
