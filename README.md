### 233. Number of Digit One
 
Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

### Move Zeros To End

Given a static-sized array of integers arr, move all zeroes in the array to the end of the array. You should preserve the relative order of items in the array.

We should implement a solution that is more efficient than a naive brute force.

Examples:
```
input:  arr = [1, 10, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 5, 7, 0]
     output:  [1, 10, 2, 8, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
### Array of Array Products
Given an array of integers arr, you’re asked to calculate for each index i the product of all integers except the integer at that index (i.e. except arr[i]). Implement a function arrayOfArrayProducts that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

Solve without using division and analyze your solution’s time and space complexities.

Examples:
```
input:  arr = [8, 10, 2]
output: [20, 16, 80] # by calculating: [10*2, 8*2, 8*10]

input:  arr = [2, 7, 3, 4]
output: [84, 24, 56, 42] # by calculating: [7*3*4, 2*3*4, 2*7*4, 2*7*3]
```
### Shortest Word Edit Path
Given two words source and target, and a list of words words, find the length of the shortest series of edits that transforms source to target.

Each edit must change exactly one letter at a time, and each intermediate word (and the final target word) must exist in words.

If the task is impossible, return -1.

Examples:
```
source = "bit", target = "dog"
words = ["but", "put", "big", "pot", "pog", "dog", "lot"]

output: 5
explanation: bit -> but -> put -> pot -> pog -> dog has 5 transitions.
source = "no", target = "go"
words = ["to"]

output: -1
```

### Toeplitz Matrix
A Toeplitz matrix is a matrix where every left-to-right-descending diagonal has the same element. Given a non-empty matrix arr, write a function that returns true if and only if it is a Toeplitz matrix. The matrix can be any dimensions, not necessarily square.

For example,

```
[[1,2,3,4],
 [5,1,2,3],
 [6,5,1,2]]
```
is a Toeplitz matrix, so we should return true, while

```
[[1,2,3,4],
 [5,1,9,3],
 [6,5,1,2]]
```
isn’t a Toeplitz matrix, so we should return false.

### BST Successor Search
In a Binary Search Tree (BST), an Inorder Successor of a node is defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node (see examples below). Given a node inputNode in a BST, you’re asked to write a function findInOrderSuccessor that returns the Inorder Successor of inputNode. If inputNode has no Inorder Successor, return null.

Explain your solution and analyze its time and space complexities.

```
             20
           9   25
         5  12
           11 14
```           

In this diagram, the inorder successor of 9 is 11 and the inorder successor of 14 is 20.

Example:

In the diagram above, for inputNode whose key = 11

Your function would return:

The Inorder Successor node whose key = 12

```
class Node:

  # Constructor to create a new node
  def __init__(self, key):
    self.key = key 
    self.left = None
    self.right = None
    self.parent = None

# A binary search tree 
class BinarySearchTree:

  # Constructor to create a new BST
  def __init__(self):
    self.root = None 

  def find_in_order_successor(self, inputNode):
    pass # your code goes here

  # Given a binary search tree and a number, inserts a
  # new node with the given number in the correct place
  # in the tree. Returns the new root pointer which the
  # caller should then use(the standard trick to avoid 
  # using reference parameters)
  def insert(self, key):
    
    # 1) If tree is empty, create the root
    if (self.root is None):
      self.root = Node(key)
      return
        
    # 2) Otherwise, create a node with the key
    #    and traverse down the tree to find where to
    #    to insert the new node
    currentNode = self.root
    newNode = Node(key)
    while(currentNode is not None):
      
      if(key < currentNode.key):
        if(currentNode.left is None):
          currentNode.left = newNode;
          newNode.parent = currentNode;
          break
        else:
          currentNode = currentNode.left;
      else:
        if(currentNode.right is None):
          currentNode.right = newNode;
          newNode.parent = currentNode;
          break
        else:
          currentNode = currentNode.right;

  # Return a reference to a node in the BST by its key.
  # Use this method when you need a node to test your
  # findInOrderSuccessor function on
  def getNodeByKey(self, key):
    
    currentNode = self.root
    while(currentNode is not None):
      if(key == currentNode.key):
        return currentNode
        
      if(key < currentNode.key):
        currentNode = currentNode.left
      else:
        currentNode = currentNode.right
        
    return None

### Pairs with Specific Difference
Given an array arr of distinct integers and a nonnegative integer k, write a function findPairsWithGivenDifference that returns an array of all pairs [x,y] in arr, such that x - y = k. If no such pairs exist, return an empty array.

Note: the order of the pairs in the output array should maintain the order of the y element in the original array.

Examples:
```
input:  arr = [0, -1, -2, 2, 1], k = 1
output: [[1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, -2], [2, 1]]

input:  arr = [1, 7, 5, 3, 32, 17, 12], k = 17
output: []
```

template
```
def find_pairs_with_given_difference(arr, k):
  pass
```

### Array Quadruplet
Given an unsorted array of integers arr and a number s, write a function findArrayQuadruplet that finds four numbers (quadruplet) in arr that sum up to s. Your function should return an array of these numbers in an ascending order. If such a quadruplet doesn’t exist, return an empty array.

Note that there may be more than one quadruplet in arr whose sum is s. You’re asked to return the first one you encounter (considering the results are sorted).

Explain and code the most efficient solution possible, and analyze its time and space complexities.

Example:
```
input:  arr = [2, 7, 4, 0, 9, 5, 1, 3], s = 20

output: [0, 4, 7, 9] # The ordered quadruplet of (7, 4, 0, 9)
                     # whose sum is 20. Notice that there
                     # are two other quadruplets whose sum is 20:
                     # (7, 9, 1, 3) and (2, 4, 9, 5), but again you’re
                     # asked to return the just one quadruplet (in an
                     # ascending order)
```

template
```
def find_array_quadruplet(arr, s):
  pass
```
### K-Messed Array Sort
Given an array of integers arr where each element is at most k places away from its sorted position, code an efficient function sortKMessedArray that sorts arr. For instance, for an input array of size 10 and k = 2, an element belonging to index 6 in the sorted array will be located at either index 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 in the input array.

Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.

Example:
```
input:  arr = [1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6, 10, 9], k = 2

output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

```
def sort_k_messed_array(arr, k):
    pass
```

### Busiest Time in The Mall
The Westfield Mall management is trying to figure out what the busiest moment at the mall was last year. You’re given data extracted from the mall’s door detectors. Each data point is represented as an integer array whose size is 3. The values at indices 0, 1 and 2 are the timestamp, the count of visitors, and whether the visitors entered or exited the mall (0 for exit and 1 for entrance), respectively. Here’s an example of a data point: [ 1440084737, 4, 0 ].

Note that time is given in a Unix format called Epoch, which is a nonnegative integer holding the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970.

Given an array, data, of data points, write a function findBusiestPeriod that returns the time at which the mall reached its busiest moment last year. The return value is the timestamp, e.g. 1480640292. Note that if there is more than one period with the same visitor peak, return the earliest one.

Assume that the array data is sorted in an ascending order by the timestamp. Explain your solution and analyze its time and space complexities.

Example:
```
input:  data = [ [1487799425, 14, 1], 
                 [1487799425, 4,  0],
                 [1487799425, 2,  0],
                 [1487800378, 10, 1],
                 [1487801478, 18, 0],
                 [1487801478, 18, 1],
                 [1487901013, 1,  0],
                 [1487901211, 7,  1],
                 [1487901211, 7,  0] ]

output: 1487800378 # since the increase in the number of people
                   # in the mall is the highest at that point
```

```
def find_busiest_period(data):
    pass
```

### Shifted Array Search
A sorted array of distinct integers shiftArr is shifted to the left by an unknown offset and you don’t have a pre-shifted copy of it. For instance, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 becomes 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, after shifting it twice to the left.

Given shiftArr and an integer num, implement a function shiftedArrSearch that finds and returns the index of num in shiftArr. If num isn’t in shiftArr, return -1. Assume that the offset can be any value between 0 and arr.length - 1.

Explain your solution and analyze its time and space complexities.

Example:

```
input:  shiftArr = [9, 12, 17, 2, 4, 5], num = 2 # shiftArr is the
                                                 # outcome of shifting
                                                 # [2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 17]
                                                 # three times to the left

output: 3 # since it’s the index of 2 in arr
```
```
def shifted_arr_search(shiftArr, num):
    pass
```
### Array Index & Element Equality
Given a sorted array arr of distinct integers, write a function indexEqualsValueSearch that returns the lowest index i for which arr[i] == i. Return -1 if there is no such index. Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution and explain its correctness.

Examples:
```
input: arr = [-8,0,2,5]
output: 2 # since arr[2] == 2

input: arr = [-1,0,3,6]
output: -1 # since no index in arr satisfies arr[i] == i.
```
```
def index_equals_value_search(arr):
    pass
```
### Matrix Spiral Copy
Given a 2D array (matrix) inputMatrix of integers, create a function spiralCopy that copies inputMatrix’s values into a 1D array in a spiral order, clockwise. Your function then should return that array. Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.

Example:
```
input:  inputMatrix  = [ [1,    2,   3,  4,    5],
                         [6,    7,   8,  9,   10],
                         [11,  12,  13,  14,  15],
                         [16,  17,  18,  19,  20] ]

output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12]
```

```
def spiral_copy(inputMatrix):
  pass # your code goes here
```
