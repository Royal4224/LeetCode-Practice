233. Number of Digit One
 
Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

Move Zeros To End

Given a static-sized array of integers arr, move all zeroes in the array to the end of the array. You should preserve the relative order of items in the array.

We should implement a solution that is more efficient than a naive brute force.

Examples:
```
input:  arr = [1, 10, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 5, 7, 0]
     output:  [1, 10, 2, 8, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
